  description: Human learner who is making machines learn. Experience with machine learning, web scraping, data analysis and implementing neural network architectures. Interested in AI and Cyber Security.
  journey: I learn things the hard way.. Back in the day, I didn't even knew what Machine Learning was. Still, I had an idea to implement and surfing over the net it came to know that it's a topic of research in NLP called "Machine Comprehension" which can be solved using Deep Learning. Worked out a year and was successful in implementing a model to solve it.
