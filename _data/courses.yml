- title: CS224d - Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing 
  provider: Stanford University
  summary: Learnt word vector representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models, recursive neural networks and convolutional neural networks. It taught me embeddings at different levels, architectures of common networks to solve NLP based problems and also gave information about various on-going research topics in NLP.
