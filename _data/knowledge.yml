Machine Learning:
  - Statistical concepts like Mean, Standard Deviations and Gaussian Distributions along with probability theory for algorithms like Naive Bayes and Gaussian Mixture Models.
  - Advance Mathematical concepts like Convex Optimizations, Quadratic Programming, and Partial Differentiation <i>(actually, I reinvented partial differentiation without knowing that it is already invented in high school)</i>.
  - Different architectures of ANNs, Loss functions, Backpropagation and Optimization, Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Normalization.
  - Word2vec, Attention, Encoder-Decoder architectures and several concepts to solve problems in Natural Language Processing.
  - Object detection, Image classification, Image Segmentation, Face recognition and several other solutions in Computer Vision.
  - BiDAF, R-NET, S-NET, BERT and few other models as well as datasets in field of NLP.
  - ResNet, Inception, Xception, VGG like models, datasets like PascalVOC, MSCOCO, Imagenet and algorithms of CV such as RCNN, Faster-RCNN and SSD.
  - In short, the basics required to solve any given problem.

Software Engineering:
  - In Code Management, Source Control and Continuous Integration.
  - In Development, Software Design Principles (SOLID) and Design Patterns.
  - Approaches to solve a problem such as Divide and Conquer and Dynamic Programming.
  - 12-factor app methodology.
  - Computer Organization and Architecture, Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Databases, Encryption and Cryptography, and Computer Networks.
  - In Testing and Debugging, writing Unit Tests, Integration Testing, Performance Testing, Load Testing, Stress Testing, etc.  
  - Deployment strategies such as Big-Bang Deployment, Rolling Deployment, Blue-Green (Red-Black or A/B) Deployment.

Cyber Security:
  - Computer Networking theory and a little bit in practice.
  - Packet filtering and analysis.
  - DNS, Firewalls, Honeypots, setting up Demilitarized Zones, and other concepts.
  - Attacks on networks such as DNS poisoning, packet spoofing, password stealing, diverting traffic, DoS and DDos, etc.
  - Attacks on web application such as Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection, etc.
